# Game Hub
This project is a simple game hub that allows the user to choose between three games: Ping Pong, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Snake.
The user can select the game they want to play by clicking the corresponding button on the main menu. Each button runs the corresponding python script for the selected game.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Tkinter library

## Running the project
- Clone the repository or download the project files.
- Make sure you have python3 and tkinter library installed on your computer.
- Go to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run the following command to start the program.
<br />```python3 game_hub.py```

## Game Scripts
The game scripts for the Ping Pong, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Snake games must be in the same directory as the game_hub.py file. The scripts should be named ping_pong.py, tic_tac_toe.py, and snake.py respectively.

## Note
Please make sure the python files of the games are in the same directory as the game_hub.py file, otherwise the program will not be able to find them.
